			<h1>Long Bright River: A Novel</h1>
			<h3>Author: Liz Moore</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Alternating its present-day mystery with the story of the sisters' childhood and adolescence, Long Bright River is at once heart-pounding and heart-wrenching: a gripping suspense novel that is also a moving story of sisters, addiction, and the formidable ties that persist between place, family, and fate.</p>
