			<h1>Book: Girl, Woman, Other</h1>
			<h3>Author: Bernardine Evaristo </h3>
			<br>
			<p>Girl, Woman, Other is about struggle, but it is also about love, joy and imagination. The book culminates with her protagonists – black women of different generations, faiths, classes, politics and heritages, and a few men too – thrown together at a party for a soap opera-style grand finale.</p>
