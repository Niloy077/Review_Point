<h1>Benefits of visiting library</h1>

<p>Visiting the library can encourage reading and exploration in children. Children can learn at every turn. Even being responsible for returning books on time can teach some basics of responsibility.

Studies have shown that students who visit the library tend to have better test scores than those who don't. Studies have also shown that reading can aid in brain development in young children, so it's important to read to them and encourage them to read and visit the library from a very young age.

<p>You can find rare, out-of-print material at your local library that you won't be able to find elsewhere. You'll also be able to find old and used books for sale at a great price, so make sure to keep your eyes open for any of their cheap book sales.

If you haven't been to your local library, you may be shocked to find what kind of food and shopping options they have. For instance, the Los Angeles Public Library has a gift shop, restaurant, and caf√© inside, but it could all be easily missed if you don't know what you're looking for and don't take the time to really map out your library and find out what they offer.</p>
<p>The library is full of other bookworms. You can bond over your favorite books and love of literature. Libraries often promote local businesses, so you can also find out more about local artists, businesses, and even book clubs.

And the librarian probably has an abundance of useful information and recommendations. Just let them know what you're looking for and they can help you find the right book or answer any questions you may have. (See also: 17 Cool Jobs for Book Lovers)</p>
<p>We all need a bit of personal space, and the library can provide the quiet reprieve you need. It's a great place for reading, working, researching, or just relaxing. There are always comfy chairs and corners at the library where you can enjoy a great new book and expand your mind.

The library is brightly lit, so you won't have to squint your eyes to see the words on the page. Add that to the cool environment, quiet atmosphere, and endless rows of books, and you've got a very calming way to relieve stress and relax.</p>
