			<h1>War and Peace </h1>
			<h3>Author: Leo Tolstoy</h3>
			<br>
			<p>War and Peace broadly focuses on Napoleonâ€™s invasion of Russia in 1812 and follows three of the most well-known characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves his family behind to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman who intrigues both men.</p>
